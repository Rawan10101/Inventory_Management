# Inventory Management

## Project Description

This project represents the data behind a multi-merchant food and retail platform, similar to a system used by restaurants, cafés, or shops to manage sales, inventory, and marketing in one place. The goal of the project is to make it easy to analyze revenue, track inventory, and understand how merchants and customers interact with the platform.

What the Platform Does
The platform earns money in two main ways:

### Platform Revenue
Money earned from merchants through invoices and transaction fees.
### Merchant Revenue
Money earned when customers buy food or products from merchants.

### All dates are stored as UNIX timestamps, and all money values are in Danish Kroner (DKK).

Inventory & Menu Management

The project includes a full inventory system that connects raw ingredients to menu items. This makes it possible to:

1- Track stock levels of ingredients and products
2- See how menu items are built using recipes (bill of materials)
3- Manage SKUs, stock categories, and add-ons
4- Monitor inventory reports and stock differences over time
