# Assumptions and Limitations

- Forecasts are based on historical sales and may degrade when menu items change drastically.
- Holiday effects use US federal holidays only.
- Ramadan seasonality is a placeholder in the baseline feature set.
- Promotion optimization uses co-purchase frequency and does not include price elasticity.
- Prep planning requires a bill of materials; otherwise prep is skipped.
- Inventory snapshots are assumed to be accurate at the report date.
